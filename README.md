## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project is a **Calorie Prediction Model** that estimates the number of calories burned based on user input such as age, weight, heart rate, duration, and body temperature. We use **Machine Learning (XGBoost, SVR, Random Forest)** for predictions and **FastAPI** to serve the model as a web app. The frontend is beautifully designed with a modern **glassmorphism UI** and animated elements for an engaging user experience.
